00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:01.800
Welcome back to  00STEEN REPLACED BY EDITS00

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.349
It's a show about everything local from the farm to the table.

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:12.730
I'm CUSTOM VOCABULARY REPLACED JEFF STEEN now the last couple of episodes we focused on to Boulder culinary icon Black cat

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.750
kitchen and she talked with dining hall.

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:20.500
Now both have deep roots in the Boulder community, which is why this episode, we wanted to feature something a little bit

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.260
newer, Fresh times eatery.

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:29.699
The first time, it's only been open for two years since 2000 and 13 and while they have the same farm to table ethos with

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.560
black cat taco dining hall, there's something else going on here.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.859
It has to do with holistic wellness.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.689
There's also an interesting back story, but that's probably best told by owner Christine route.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:47.700
So let's go inside and get a little bit of that history and head to the kitchen where we'll make a delicious pasta operating

00:00:58.439 --> 00:01:05.230
okay, Christine, thanks for having us today to tell us a little bit about concept as far as it being a farm to table restaurant

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.569
but also one that has a strong promotion for holistic wellness.

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:18.180
I was a culinary instructor for Bowman College, I'm a holistic natural chef and so that means that anything that I create

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:19.769
is done with health in mind.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:29.700
And I talked for a long time and I had a private clients and then I also would work with alternative care practitioners naturopaths

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:38.400
acupuncturists um, and nutritionists and I would help people transition their diets after health diagnosis, um, or people

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.840
transition their diets if they were like athletes.

00:01:40.849 --> 00:01:43.299
Um, and I did that for a long time.

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:49.810
I did that for about six years and realized that there was really a need for people to have the kind of food that I

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.180
was endorsing and that people are purchasing and whole foods and natural grocers and stuff like that.

00:01:55.189 --> 00:02:02.560
Um, for them to have a place to go eat like that outside of you also have a very interesting personal history that sort of

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:03.790
contributed to the concept.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:04.760
Tell us a little about that.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:13.439
In 2006 I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and uh, it was just a really great opportunity for me to sort of merged two

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:14.629
parts of my life.

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:23.539
Um, one was very geared towards health and the other that was very good towards food and so, um, and then I was also diagnosed

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:31.479
with celiac disease and having those two diagnoses really changed the way I looked at food and health and flavor and everything

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:32.069
like that.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.599
You also partnered with a lot of local farms and markets for the ingredients here.

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:38.120
What are some of those that you're working with currently?

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:46.099
Yeah, well we've partnered with a lot of the farms that um, lots of other restaurants partner with and it's super fun to

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:52.520
just have them walk in bob Munson, just walked in the other day with big bag full of spinach and his lettuce and in the

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:58.840
middle of a busy lunch and he's like Stephan spinach in my mouth telling me like here trying to finish every day.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.060
We've been open a year and a half.
